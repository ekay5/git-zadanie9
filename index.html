        <h1>Hollywood Boulevard is Quentin Tarantino’s 1960s playground</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Never question Quentin Tarantino’s commitment to his films. For the past week, a one-block stretch of Hollywood Boulevard—between Las Palmas and Cherokee—has become Tarantino’s vintage Los Angeles playground. It’s for his latest feature, <span style="color: red;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,</span> set in 1969, and the attention to detail is astonishing.</p>
        <p>Tarantino’s 10-year passion project is a composite of overlapping stories taking place in the film industry at a time when old Hollywood began to collide with new Hollywood.</p>
        <p>The main characters portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are rumored to be loosely based on legendary stuntman Hal Needham, and (then-roommate) Burt Reynolds. Needham was best known for his frequent collaborations with Reynolds. Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie, is their neighbor.</p>
